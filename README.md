# Data Science Portfolio
Portfolio of data science projects completed by me for self learning and hobby purposes.

## Projects
- [Predicting Airbnb Listing Prices in Taipei](https://github.com/lisacheng-choco/airbnb-demand-price-analysis/blob/master/airbnb_pricing_prediction.ipynb): A model to predict the price of a given Airbnb listing in Taipei using statistical analysis tools and machine learning algorithms. Identified the optimal model that a host can set a reasonable price based on the properties of a listing.
- [The Impact of COVID-19 on Airbnb Market in Taipei: Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/lisacheng-choco/airbnb-demand-price-analysis/blob/master/airbnb_covid19_analysis.ipynb): Analysis of how the Airbnb market and hosts in Taipei have responded and adapted their business to the pandemic.
- [HousePricing: Find the best transformers using Pipeline with GridSearchCV](https://www.kaggle.com/chiaoyicheng/data-transformer-selection-with-pipeline): Experiment of how to combine Pipeline and GridSearchCV to find the best Scaler, Imputer, and different transformers for the machine learning models by using [House Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) in Kaggle.
- [Otto Group Product Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/chiaoyicheng/ensemble-model): The challenge is a multiple classification problem on Kaggle. Built an ensemble model to predict category based on information about products. The score of ensemble model was better than any individual model. Techniques included optimization algorithm and hyperparameter tuning.
