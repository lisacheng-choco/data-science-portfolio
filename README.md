# Data Science Portfolio
Portfolio of data science projects completed by me for self learning and hobby purposes.

## Projects
- [Predicting Airbnb Listing Prices in Taipei](https://github.com/lisacheng-choco/airbnb-demand-price-analysis/blob/master/airbnb_pricing_prediction.ipynb): A model to predict the price of a given Airbnb listing in Taipei using statistical analysis tools and machine learning algorithms. Identified the optimal model that a host can set a reasonable price based on the properties of a listing.
- [Impact of COVID-19 on Airbnb Market in Taipei: Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/lisacheng-choco/airbnb-demand-price-analysis/blob/master/airbnb_covid19_analysis.ipynb): Analysis of how the Airbnb market and hosts in Taipei have responded and adapted their business to the pandemic.
- [HousePricing: Find the Best Transformers Using Pipeline & GridSearchCV](https://www.kaggle.com/chiaoyicheng/data-transformer-selection-with-pipeline): Experiment of how to combine Pipeline and GridSearchCV to find the best Scaler, Imputer, and different transformers to boost the performance of machine learning models by using [House Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) on Kaggle.
- [Otto Group Product Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/chiaoyicheng/ensemble-model): The challenge is a multiple classification problem on Kaggle. Built an ensemble model to predict category based on information about products. Techniques included optimization algorithm and hyperparameter tuning.  

*Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib*
